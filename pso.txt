Causes: 
The cause of psoriasis is not fully known, but it is believed to stem from a problem with the immune system, particularly with the role of a type of white blood cell, called a T lymphocyte or "T cell". T cells are responsible for fighting off infected cells or foreign substances, but in the case of individuals with psoriasis, the T cells attack healthy skin cells.   

Diagnosis:

Psoriasis can be dignosed in most cases through medical history and a physical exam. Your physician can usually diagnose the condition by examining the skin, scalp, and nails. In some cases, a biopsy can be taken to eliminate other possible skin conditions.
